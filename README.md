Simple Cisco Router GUI Made in QT Editor.

Adds configuration to a text file, will probably add ability upload config through console port.

A work in progress, security checks still need to be added.
Some more commands still need to be added.
Will probably intergrate Switch features when I have time to.
UI still needs work, but is functional.
